# Analyzing the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year Award Winners
In this project, I take a look at the defensive statistics of every player in the league. The ultimate goal is to see if the voted Defensive Player of the Year matches who SHOULD have won based on the stats. The data was retrieved from the [Official NBA Stats Website](https://www.nba.com/stats/).

## Programs Used
+ **SQL:** Used to collect, clean, join, and transform the data. <br>
+ **Tableau:** Used to create the data visualization of the results.

## Data Definitions
  + **Steals per Game:** Number of times a defensive player or team takes the ball from a player on offense, causing a turnover (averaged per game played).<br>
  + **Blocks per Game:** Number of times an offensive player attempts a shot, and the defense player tips the ball, blocking their chance to score (averaged per game played).<br>
  + **Individual Defensive Rating:** Number of points per 100 possessions that the team allows while that individual player is on the court.<br>
  + **Total Contested Shots:** Number of times a defensive player or team closes out and raises a hand to contest a shot prior to its release.<br>
  + **Defended Field Goal Percentage:** The opponent's field goal percentage on shots when the player is defending the shot.<br>
  + **Defensive Win Shares:** Estimate of how many wins a player contributes to their team through their defensive abilities<br>
  + **Individual Wins:** Number of team wins in which the player participated in.<be>
  + **DPOY Rating:** A rating calculated using sum of the Z-scores of each player's defensive statistics. A negative DPOY Rating denotes a bad defender, and the higher the DPOY Rating, the better the defender.
